      <h3>What is Breakfast?</h3>
      <p>
        Breakfast is the first meal of the day, typically eaten after waking up in the morning. 
        It serves as the initial fuel for your body, replenishing the energy and nutrients that your body needs after hours of sleep. 
        Traditionally, breakfast is considered an important meal because it kickstarts your metabolism and sets the tone for the rest of the day.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Why is Breakfast Important?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Boosts Energy Levels:</b> Breakfast provides the body with essential nutrients and energy, helping you feel refreshed and ready to take on the day.</li>
        <li><b>Improves Concentration and Performance:</b> Studies show that eating a nutritious breakfast improves focus, memory, and overall cognitive performance.</li>
        <li><b>Supports Metabolism:</b> A healthy breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism, helping your body burn calories efficiently throughout the day.</li>
        <li><b>Reduces Hunger Pangs:</b> Eating a balanced breakfast can prevent overeating later in the day, which helps in maintaining a healthy weight.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>What’s Good for Breakfast?</h3>
      <p><b>A nutritious breakfast should include a mix of:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Carbohydrates:</b> Whole-grain bread, oatmeal, or fruits for sustained energy.</li>
        <li><b>Protein:</b> Eggs, Greek yogurt, nuts, or lean meats to keep you full longer.</li>
        <li><b>Healthy Fats:</b> Avocados, seeds, or nut butter for brain and heart health.</li>
        <li><b>Fiber:</b> Fruits, vegetables, or whole grains to aid digestion and provide lasting energy.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>How to Choose a Healthy Breakfast?</h3>
      <img class="image" src="../images/food5.jpg" alt="Healthy breakfast image">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Balance Your Plate:</b> Include a variety of food groups—protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates—for a well-rounded meal.</li>
        <li><b>Limit Sugar and Processed Foods:</b> Avoid sugary cereals or pastries, as they can lead to energy crashes later in the day.</li>
        <li><b>Plan Ahead:</b> Prep ingredients the night before or opt for quick, healthy options like smoothies or overnight oats for busy mornings.</li>
        <li><b>Listen to Your Body:</b> Choose foods that make you feel good and provide lasting energy. Everyone’s nutritional needs are different, so find what works best for you.</li>
