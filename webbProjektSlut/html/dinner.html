      <h3>What is Dinner?</h3>
      <p>
        Dinner is the final meal of the day, typically eaten in the evening, often between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. It provides the necessary nutrients and energy to end your day. A well-balanced dinner can help you unwind, relax, and prepare for a restful night’s sleep.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Why is Dinner Important?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Completes Your Daily Nutrition:</b> Dinner is an opportunity to round off your day’s nutritional intake. It ensures your body has the necessary fuel to maintain optimal health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Supports Muscle Repair and Recovery:</b> If you’ve been active during the day, dinner can offer a chance to replenish lost nutrients and support muscle recovery, especially when paired with a good source of protein.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Promotes Better Sleep:</b> A well-balanced dinner, especially one with complex carbs and proteins, can contribute to better sleep quality. Certain foods help release melatonin, which aids in falling asleep faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Prevents Nighttime Snacking:</b> A healthy dinner reduces cravings for unhealthy late-night snacks, ensuring you don’t overeat before bed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>What’s Good for Dinner?</h3>
      <img class="image" src="../images/food9.jpg" alt="Healthy Dinner Options">
      <p><b>A healthy dinner should include:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Proteins:</b> Fish, poultry, lean meats, tofu, or legumes to support muscle health and satiety.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Complex Carbohydrates:</b> Brown rice, quinoa, whole-wheat pasta, or sweet potatoes to provide lasting energy without blood sugar spikes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Healthy Fats:</b> Olive oil, avocado, nuts, or seeds for heart health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fiber:</b> Vegetables, leafy greens, and whole grains to support digestion and fullness.
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>How to Choose a Healthy Dinner?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Prioritize Protein:</b> Opt for a source of lean protein to repair muscles and keep you full throughout the evening. Grilled fish, chicken, or plant-based proteins like beans and lentils are great choices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Include Healthy Carbs:</b> Choose complex carbs like whole grains, legumes, or starchy vegetables, which provide a steady energy release and promote better sleep.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add Colorful Vegetables:</b> Include a variety of colorful vegetables to provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Aim for a variety of greens, reds, yellows, and oranges for a nutrient-dense meal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Avoid Heavy Meals:</b> Try to avoid large, greasy, or overly rich meals, as they can cause discomfort and affect your sleep quality. A lighter dinner with balanced nutrients is ideal for digestion and rest.
        </li>
