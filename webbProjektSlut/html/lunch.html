      <h3>What is Lunch?</h3>
      <p>
        Lunch is the second main meal of the day, typically eaten between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. It serves as a break from your work or daily activities, providing nourishment to sustain energy levels through the afternoon. A balanced lunch should keep you fueled and prevent a mid-afternoon slump.
